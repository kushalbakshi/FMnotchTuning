While the code in this repository serves as basic importing, filtering, and plotting of microelectrode array data, the main purpose is to practice git and version control

The 'notchTune' jupyter file is a standalone prototyping file whereas the .py files are in functional code format to allow integration into a larger coding package with ease. Both provide the same results.

The notchRaster file uses spike times in a csv file to generate the rasters whereas NotchRasterMUA imports .pl2 files (Plexon-acquired electrophysiology data), filters for spikes, and subsequently creates and saves rasters.
